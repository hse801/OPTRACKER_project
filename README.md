## Introduction

With the advancement of technology, ***autonomous driving-oriented future mobility*** is becoming a reality, not a distant future. Accordingly, social interest in how future mobility technology can be applied to the transportation disadvantaged is also increasing. In order to move forward to a better future away from the reality where everyone cannot enjoy the advantages of future mobility, various forms of personal mobility and new modes of transportation such as PBV (Purpose Built Vehicle) that can be used by everyone are needed!

<br/>

***Wheelchairs*** show their true value when various functions are added to the purpose or user specificity. Users with visual or hearing difficulties, as well as situations where walking or movement is difficult for physical reasons, can use functions such as autonomous driving to move to their destination without the help of a guardian.

## Design Objective

Personal mobility development uses **AI object recognition and tracking technology** to recognize only one of the various objects captured by the camera in real time, and to **link the coordinate value of the object to motor driving** to drive only the object at a certain distance.

- Implementation of autonomous driving technology at limited cost
- Solving the safety problem of autonomous driving by maintaining distance
- Implementation of object recognition technology that is not limited by special devices

## Software Design

The solution OPTRACKER we propose has ***four main functions***
